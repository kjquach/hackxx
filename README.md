## Inspiration
We planned to work on a programming side project to improve our programming skills but had a hard time coming up with ideas. We thought that it would be helpful to have a random prompt generator, as inspired by an online random prompt generator for product and graphic design, to provide us a place to start. We believe that the best way to learn programming is through first hand experience and exploration. Computing classes provide prompts to students, yet not everyone has access to these resources. By creating this program, we hope to level the socioeconomic and gender disparities among the population. Specifically, we hope to extend this opportunity to women to increase interest in this field. 

## What it does
Our project generates programming project ideas and provide resources to increase programming exposure. It includes links to guide the programming process. It also includes biographies of underrepresented famous female computer programmers from different backgrounds. 

## How we built it 
We used an external file of javascript and incorporated it into our html file. We also used a CSS file to style our website.

## Challenges we ran into
- Internet failure and internet connectivity
- github hosting error

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- getting the display to jump to a specific spot when button is clicked
- learning to make a website using javascript, html, and CSS

## What we learned
- basic javascript
- how to use github

## What's next for var eunoia;
- Expanding amount of possible genres and topics
- include more in-depth resources
- create levels of difficulty to cater to audiences with different computing backgrounds
